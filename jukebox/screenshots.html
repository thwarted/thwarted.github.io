<h1>Screenshots</h1>

<p>
Note that some of the icons, along with the logo I've chosen, are images co-opted and hand-edited from
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat's</a> Bluecurve icon set in RH9.  It would be cool if I had mad 
graphic artist skillz, but I don't.  Please forgive me.
</p>

<p>
The outputs have been renamed in these screenshots, from "left" and "right", to "main" and "backup".  Astute readers 
will also notice the background images on the more recent versions.  I chose this image because it's easy to tell if 
the image isn't being drawn correctly or the alpha on the widgets isn't working like it should.  I'm sorry, I can't 
remember where I downloaded this image from, but it's pretty damn cool, being a closeup of cauliflower.
</p>

<p>
All thumbnails are 300x200 and are under 20k in size.  The screenshots themselves are either fullsize 1024x768 (100k
each) or reduced to 800x600 (under 50k).

<p>
One thing you can't see in these screenshots is the support for animated icons.  If there is something queued up and 
playing, the "now playing" icon (upper left) has musical notes coming out of it.  If the ripper is currently active
musical notes flash over its icon (the red colored CD in the upper right).

<hr>

<p>
The latest version has a static icon bar across the top containing three icons.  On the left is the 
"now playing" icon, which will take you to the "now playing" screen.  In the middle is the "album picker"
icon, which shows the list of all albums.  The screen saver can be manually activated using the icon on the
right.
</p>
<p>
Note that the references to "left" and "right" in the screenshots designate one of the multiple output 
channels that are supported.  I had my two sets of speakers set up on the left and right of myself for 
testing.  In my production setting, I plan on having at least two outputs, "kitchen" and "pool room", 
and perhaps "library" as a third, as my house is already wired with (cheap-ass) speakers (that need to 
be replaced).
